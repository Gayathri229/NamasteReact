  Emmets are shortcuts that we can use while coding in Vscode.  We type in an abbreviation and Vscode converts it into a line/block of code for us.

2. Difference between library and framework.  
   Library - Can be used anywhere i.e. even when the whole app is coded in a different language we can use React to code just a part of the page or a component in the page. The application's flow and structure control is with the developer.
   Framework - Controls the flow of the control, flow of the application. Has its own rules, restrictions, and boundaries.

      The first one is used when we are developing where code optimization, minification, compression, etc won't happen and the second one is used when pushing to production, here all the code optimization, etc is done to make the website work efficiently and faster.

8. What are async and defer?   
   Async and defer are attributes used with the script tag.  
     Async - Fetches scripts asynchronously alongside HTML parsing. Pauses parsing and executes scripts as soon as they're available. Doesn't guarantee the order of execution of scripts.  
     Defer - Fetches scripts asynchronously alongside HTML parsing. Only after HTML parsing is complete, executes the scripts. Guarantees order of execution of scripts.
