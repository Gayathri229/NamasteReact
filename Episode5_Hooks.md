Best practices for coding/maintaining clean code:
  - Separate files for separate components.  
  - All the main code should be under the "src" folder.

  - If it is a component name, try to match the file name exactly as the component name. File name: Header.js, Component name: Header.
  - Using .js or .jsx extension when naming files doesn't matter.
