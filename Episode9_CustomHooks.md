Single Responsibility Principle:  
Any single identity i.e. function/class/any single identity should have only a single responsibility.  

Modularity:  
Maintaining modularity(splitting code into different small modules) helps to make the code more reusable, maintainable, and testable.  

Custom Hooks:  
Hooks: Special JS utility functions given by React.  
We extract some responsibility from a component into a Hook so that both the component and Hook become more modular.
