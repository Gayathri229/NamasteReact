*IGNITING OUR APP*

React alone doesn't make an app faster. React along with many other libraries help making the app faster.

NPM DOES NOT HAVE A FULL FORM. It manages packages but doesn't stand for Node package Manager.

"package.json" file is the configuration for npm. After we provide all the configurations for our npm, this file gets generated.

Most important package:
Bundler - Helps to Minify/cache/compress/clean the code before it is sent to production. (Webpack, Vite, Parcel). Packages the app so that it can be shipped to production.

We can install 2 types of dependencies. Dev dependencies and normal dependencies. 
Dev dependencies - Used when we develop
Normal dependencies - Used in production
