Before starting to build an APP - FOOD ORDERING APP
1. Planning
     You should know exactly what you're going to build. - Food ordering app    
     A UI Mock. Once we have a visual picture of what we're going to do, it'll be very easy to code. - UI mock/ Wireframe/ hand-drawn design etc  
     Low-level planning. What components can my app have? - Header, Body, Footer
         In header - Logo Component, Nav items
         In Body - Search Component, Restaurant Container - Restaurant Cards
         In Footer - Copyright, Links, Address, Contact
