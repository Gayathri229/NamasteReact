Before starting to build an APP - FOOD ORDERING APP
1. Planning
     You should know exactly what you're going to build. - Food ordering app    
     A UI Mock. Once we have a visual picture of what we're going to do, it'll be very easy to code. - UI mock/ Wireframe/ hand-drawn design etc  
     Low-level planning. What components can my app have? - Header, Body, Footer
         In header - Logo Component, Nav items
         In Body - Search Component, Restaurant Container - Restaurant Cards
         In Footer - Copyright, Links, Address, Contact

PROPERTIES:  
If we want to pass dynamic values to Components, we can do it through PROPS. Props are nothing but arguments. i.e. Components are functions in JS and Props are arguments to functions/Components.  
React  wraps the Props into an Object and passes to the component as Arguments.

Here, we have passed resName and cuisine as arguments to the RestaurantCard component as props. Since, functions and arguments are part of JS, we've accessed the JS code using the curly braces. Also since the properties are wrapped as an object, we've accessed it using the dot notation.

We can also destructure the arguments as well, as shown in the below images,
